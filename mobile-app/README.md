# Presensia - Mobile (Expo)

This directory contains the React Native (Expo) mobile app skeleton for Presensia.

Contains:
- Expo entry `App.js`
- `src/` with screens, components, navigation, context, services and styles

To run (if you have Expo CLI installed):

```bash
cd mobile-app
npm install
npm run start
```

This is a UI skeleton. Connect to your backend API by editing `src/services/api.js` and implementing auth flows in `src/context/AuthContext.js`.
